# About me
:man_technologist:
I am a software developer with experience in a variety of programming languages and technologies. 
My primary focus is on web development, using languages such as Python, JavaScript, 
and Node.js to build scalable and efficient applications. 
I also have experience with lower-level languages such as C, and am proficient in SQL for managing and querying data. 
In my work, I strive to write clean, maintainable code and am always looking for ways to improve my skills and knowledge.
